# howTo
This repository is a self guide to help me in some topics. I pretend to dive into data manipulation, critical topics in modelling and graphic analysis. 

### sampling

SRS or Simple Random Sample is the way you randomize all data set into random picks in the data.

Stratified its a way to pick randomly equal numbers of data under a group.




## dates and datetimes
Some base functions wrote in C and functions from lubridate package to manipulate date objects

### R base funtions
Added some example codes to r Base functions to format date and datetimes




## Time Series
Analyzing time series since simple manipulation until modelling with Arima and others autocorrelated models.

### Manipulation
Time Series manipulation with xts and zoo packages, like subsetting for periods, operations for simple add scalars and merge series.

### Lagging and Differencing Series
Creating endpoints and applying functions by time with period.apply generic functions and their methods.

### Aggregating by time
aggregating over continous time with to.period generic function and its methods.
