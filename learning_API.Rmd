API's are today an easy and interactively way to **collect** data from web. The most common ways to do that is using R is with the packages: `httr` and `jsonlite`. 
Now we'll load some packages to work with:

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)
```

Now we'll go further and connect with a API from SpaceX to do a request:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}

url <- "https://api.spacexdata.com/v2/launches"

r1 <- GET(url = url) # request

```

The `GET()` function allow us to make a request to the API. We get a list like a response from the API, from now, let's take a look at the contents of this list:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

names(r1) # getting the name of the contents of our list

r1$status_code # our status code is 200, so the request was succesfully

r2 <- rawToChar(r1$content) # converting the hex to a string object (it converted to a JSON format)

r3 <- fromJSON(r2)  # extracting the JSON file to a list

```

We have an `class(r3)` class object with nested data

Now we can look at data and start to manipulate that to answer some questions!!

How many rockets, SpaceX lauched **successfuly** to space?

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
r3 %>% 
  select(mission_name, launch_success, is_tentative) %>% 
  filter(launch_success == TRUE, is_tentative == FALSE) %>% 
  tally()
```

How many flights are re-using the core of rocket?

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
r3$reuse %>% 
  select(core) %>% 
  filter(core == TRUE) %>% 
  tally()
```

To conclude, we can simple visualize an image from the most used rocket from SpaceX:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
r3$rocket %>% 
  select(rocket_name, rocket_type) %>%
  group_by(rocket_name) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

```
